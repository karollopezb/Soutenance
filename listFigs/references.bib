  title={{The relationship between wind power, electricity demand and winter weather patterns in Great Britain}},
  journal={Environmental Research Letters},
  volume={12},
  number={6},

  url={http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/12/i=6/a=064017},

  abstract={Wind power generation in Great Britain has increased markedly in recent years. However due to its intermittency its ability to provide power during periods of high electricity demand has been questioned. Here we characterise the winter relationship between electricity demand and the availability of wind power. Although a wide range of wind power capacity factors is seen for a given demand, the average capacity factor reduces by a third between low and high demand. However, during the highest demand average wind power increases again, due to strengthening easterly winds. The nature of the weather patterns affecting Great Britain are responsible for this relationship. High demand is driven by a range of high pressure weather types, each giving cold conditions, but variable wind power availability. Offshore wind power is sustained at higher levels and offers a more secure supply compared to that onshore. However, during high demand periods in Great Britain neighbouring countries may struggle to provide additional capacity due to concurrent low temperatures and low wind power availability.}

It employs a hybrid particle swarm optimization for optimal charging priority and location of PEVs in distribution networks, with the objectives of minimization of charging cost, power loss reduction and voltage profile improvement. The algorithm is executed on IEEE 30-bus test system. The results are compared with those that are gained by executing sample genetic algorithm (SGA) with diverse parameters on the same system. The results indicate the effectiveness and promising application of the proposed methodology.},

In 2007, humankind was able to store 2.9 {\texttimes} 1020 optimally compressed bytes, communicate almost 2 {\texttimes} 1021 bytes, and carry out 6.4 {\texttimes} 1018 instructions per second on general-purpose computers. General-purpose computing capacity grew at an annual rate of 58\%. The world{\textquoteright}s capacity for bidirectional telecommunication grew at 28\% per year, closely followed by the increase in globally stored information (23\%). Humankind{\textquoteright}s capacity for unidirectional information diffusion through broadcasting channels has experienced comparatively modest annual growth (6\%). Telecommunication has been dominated by digital technologies since 1990 (99.9\% in digital format in 2007), and the majority of our technological memory has been in digital format since the early 2000s (94\% digital in 2007).},

	ABSTRACT = {Transportation electrification has become an important issue in recent decades and the large scale deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) has yet to be achieved. The smart coordination of EV demand addresses an improvement in the flexibility of power systems and reduces the costs of power system investment. The uncertainty in EV drivers’ behaviour is one of the main problems to solve to obtain an optimal integration of EVs into power systems. In this paper, an optimisation algorithm to coordinate the charging of EVs has been developed and implemented using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), where thermal line limits, the load on transformers, voltage limits and parking availability patterns are taken into account to establish an optimal load pattern for EV charging-based reliability. This methodology has been applied to an existing residential low-voltage system. The results indicate that a smart charging schedule for EVs leads to a flattening of the load profile, peak load shaving and the prevention of the aging of power system elements.},

abstract= {A new algorithm is proposed for computing the embedding dimension and delay time in phase space reconstruction. It makes use of the zero of the nonbias multiple autocorrelation function of the chaotic time series to determine the time delay, which efficiently depresses the computing error caused by tracing arbitrarily the slop variation of average displacement (AD) in AD algorithm. Thereafter, by means of the iterative algorithm of multiple autocorrelation and $\Gamma$ test, the near-optimum parameters of embedding dimension and delay time are estimated. This algorithm is provided with a sound theoretic basis, and its computing complexity is relatively lower and not strongly dependent on the data length. The simulated experimental results indicate that the relative error of the correlation dimension of standard chaotic time series is decreased from 4.4{\%} when using conventional algorithm to 1.06{\%} when using this algorithm. The accuracy of invariants in phase space reconstruction is greatly improved.},

abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) are emerging as an efficient and sustainable alternative for private and public road transportation. From the point of view of electric grids, PEVs are currently considered as simple loads due to their low market penetration. However, as the PEV fleet grows, implementation of an intelligent management system will be necessary in order to avoid large capital expenditures in network reinforcements and negative effects on electric distribution networks, such as: voltage deviations, transformers and lines saturations, increase of electrical losses, etc. These issues may jeopardize the safety and reliability of the grid. As a consequence, this topic has been researched in many papers where a wide range of solutions have been proposed. This paper presents a review of different strategies, algorithms and methods to implement a smart charging control system. Also significant projects around the world about PEVs integration are presented. Finally, on the basis of this review, main findings and some recommendations are presented.},

publisher={Springer Berlin Heidelberg},

pages={75--102},
abstract={Derived from the concept of self-adaptation in evolution strategies, the CMA (Covariance Matrix Adaptation) adapts the covariance matrix of a multi-variate normal search distribution. The CMA was originally designed to perform well with small populations. In this review, the argument starts out with large population sizes, reflecting recent extensions of the CMA algorithm. Commonalities and differences to continuous Estimation of Distribution Algorithms are analyzed. The aspects of reliability of the estimation, overall step size control, and independence from the coordinate system (invariance) become particularly important in small populations sizes. Consequently, performing the adaptation task with small populations is more intricate.},
